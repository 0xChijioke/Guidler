# Guidler 🏗 Scaffold-ETH




> everything you need to build on Ethereum! 🚀

🧪 Quickly experiment with Solidity using a frontend that adapts to your smart contract:


> install and start your 👷‍ Hardhat chain:

```bash
cd Guidler
yarn install
yarn chain
```

> in a second terminal window, start your 📱 frontend:

```bash
cd Guidler
yarn start
```

> in a third terminal window, 🛰 deploy your contract:

```bash
cd Guidler
yarn deploy
```

# TODO
- Display all Guidlers and their owners in the Guidlers page.
- Make sure a user without a Noob minted can't mint other parts.
- Make complete Guidler tradable.
